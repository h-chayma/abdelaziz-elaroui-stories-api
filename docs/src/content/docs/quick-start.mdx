Get up and running with the **El Aroui Stories API** by following these steps.

## 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the API repository. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elaroui-stories-api
```

## 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd elaroui-stories-api
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Start the Server
Run the following command to start the server locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the server on http://localhost:3000.

### Making Your First Request
Once the server is running, you can make requests to the API endpoints. For example, to retrieve all stories, use a tool like Postman or cURL to make a GET request:

Endpoint:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/stories
```

Example Response:

```bash
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "يا قاتل الروح",
    "date": "2024-10-22",
    "story": "قالك في قديم الزمان فمّا راجل يعيش هو و زوجته في كوخ في القرية ...", 
    "youtubeId": "Bj-LeBk8p-E"
  },
  // ... more stories
]
```

Now you're ready to start exploring the stories and integrating them into your projects!
